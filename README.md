It has bhargavi singh's work
I have created a Tetris game.
Tetris game is created using Javascript.
Technologies used :
   HTML, CSS, Javascript.
 About the game:
 The player should be able to rotate each Tetrimino about the axis.
 If a line is completed it should be removed and you will receive 10 points.
 The game should stop if a Tetrimino fills the highest row of the game board.
 Hope you enjoy it.
